### Overall Coverage Statistics

- **Total Statement Coverage**: 7.37%
- **Branch Coverage**: 40%
- **Function Coverage**: 22.72%
- **Line Coverage**: 7.37%

## Primary Issues Blocking Coverage

### 1. Supabase Mock Implementation Gap

```
Error: requireSupabase(...).from(...).select(...).order is not a function
```

**Impact**: Affects Dashboard, Teams, Players, and Bouts components
**Solution Needed**: Update mock in `src/test/setup.ts` to include `.order()` method

### 2. Component Text Matching Issues

**Examples of mismatches**:

- Test expects: `/need an account/i`
- Actual text: `"Don't have an account?"`
- Test expects: `/signing in/i`
- Actual text: `"Loading..."`

**Impact**: Affects Auth component tests
**Solution Needed**: Update test assertions to match actual rendered text

### 3. Error Message Handling

- Tests expect specific error messages like "Invalid credentials"
- Components show generic "An error occurred" messages
- Need alignment between expected and actual error handling

## Recommendations

### Immediate Fixes (High Priority)

1. **Fix Supabase Mock**: Add `.order()` method to mock implementation
2. **Update Auth Tests**: Match actual rendered text patterns
3. **Standardize Error Messages**: Align test expectations with component behavior

### Medium Priority

1. **Component State Testing**: Improve loading state and error state test coverage
2. **Integration Testing**: Add tests for component interactions
3. **Data Flow Testing**: Test data loading and state management

### Testing Framework Quality Assessment

**Strengths**:

- ✅ Comprehensive test structure (7 test files covering all major components)
- ✅ Proper test environment setup with jsdom and React Testing Library
- ✅ Good separation of concerns with dedicated setup file
- ✅ Coverage reporting properly configured

**Areas for Improvement**:

- ❌ Mock implementations incomplete (missing Supabase methods)
- ❌ Test assertions don't match actual component behavior
- ❌ Error scenarios need better alignment with actual error handling

## Next Steps to Achieve Full Coverage

1. **Phase 1**: Fix Supabase mocking to enable data-dependent tests
2. **Phase 2**: Update text matching in Auth component tests
3. **Phase 3**: Re-run full test suite and generate complete coverage report
4. **Phase 4**: Target 80%+ coverage across all components

## Technical Debt Notes

- Current mocking strategy needs enhancement for complex database queries
- Test data setup could be more comprehensive
- Error boundary testing not yet implemented
- Integration between components not thoroughly tested
